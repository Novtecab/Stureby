# Project Context

## Purpose
Create an e-commerce webpage where photographs can be displayed, categorized, and sold via a payment gateway like Stripe. Users can browse photos under categories such as "People", "Magazine", "Event", and others. Additionally, include a booking service for reserving a photostudio or photographer, with integrated scheduling and payment options.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js (Frontend)
- Serverless Functions (Backend API)
- MongoDB (Database)
- A React + Typescript + Vite application called Stureby

## Project Conventions

### Code Style
We don't have strict code style guidelines, but aim for consistency.

### Architecture Patterns
Component-based architecture for the Next.js frontend and a serverless architecture for the backend API.

### Testing Strategy
Primarily manual testing, with some basic unit tests for core logic.

### Git Workflow
No strict Git workflow, but clear commit messages are preferred.

## Domain Context
Key domain concepts include: "Photographs" (with categories, metadata), "Users" (buyers, photographers), "Orders" (shopping cart, payment), "Bookings" (studio/photographer, availability, scheduling), and "Payment Gateway" (Stripe integration).

## Important Constraints
No specific constraints beyond standard web development practices.

## External Dependencies
No external dependencies beyond standard web APIs.
