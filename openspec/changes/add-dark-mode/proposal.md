## Why
To enhance user experience and provide accessibility options, a dark mode feature will be implemented, allowing users to switch between light and dark themes. This addresses user requests for a more comfortable viewing experience in low-light conditions and reduces eye strain.

## What Changes
- Add a new UI setting for theme preference (light/dark) within the Stureby (React + TypeScript + Vite) frontend.
- Implement styling changes across the Stureby application to support dark mode.
- Persist user's theme preference using local storage in the Stureby frontend.

## Impact
- Affected specs: ui-settings
- Affected code: Stureby (React + TypeScript + Vite) frontend UI components, styling, and user settings module.
